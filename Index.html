<h1>Breadth First Search:</h1>
<p>
 <class>
   BreadthFirst</class> Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm. It begins with a node, then first traverses all its adjacent. Once all adjacent are visited, then their adjacent are traversed. This is different from DFS in a way that closest vertices are visited before others. We mainly traverse vertices level by level. A lot of popular graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path, Kahn’s Algorithm, and Prim’s algorithm are based on BFS. BFS itself can be used to detect cycle in a directed and undirected graph, find shortest path in an unweighted graph and many more problems.

</p>

<h2>BFS from a Given Source:</h2>

<p>
  <class>
  The</class> algorithm starts from a given source and explores all reachable vertices from the given source. It is similar to the Breadth-First Traversal of a tree. Like tree, we begin with the given source (in tree, we begin with root) and traverse vertices level by level using a queue data structure. The only catch here is that, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array.
</p>

<p>
  Initialization: Enqueue the given source vertex into a queue and mark it as visited.


</p>

<h3>
  Exploration: While the queue is not empty:
</h3>
<ul>
  1)Dequeue a node from the queue and visit it (e.g., print its value).<br>
2)For each unvisited neighbor of the dequeued node:
</ul>
<pre>
<ul>
  *Enqueue the neighbor into the queue.
  *Mark the neighbor as visited.
</ul>
</pre>

<h3>Termination: Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty.</h5>
<p><class>
  This </class>algorithm ensures that all nodes in the graph are visited in a breadth-first manner, starting from the starting node.
